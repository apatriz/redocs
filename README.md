# redocs
This python script reads a spreadsheet column containing file names into a list, and compares it to a list of all files in a specific directory. The purpose is to identify files that should be preserved, delete the rest, execute a cleanup of the directory structure to eliminate empty directories and produce a deliverable consisting of only the needed files. It also creates a new workbook.xlsx , containing only the entries for the preserved files.
